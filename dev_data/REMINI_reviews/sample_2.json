Your app would be great, but it need some major work done on it. I’m still old school, digital photos are great, but still love my 35mm camera. Here’s the problem with your app. I took out some old photos one major photo is of my dad and his best friend. I used your app and Oh My God, I couldn’t believe how your app took a photo that was slightly blurry and needed some tone adjustment and your results was horrible. Your app took my dad’s friend glasses on his face left part of the glasses on his face, the other half was on his lips. Part of his lip was up to his nose, and the results got worse. So I did it again, and it came out the same. I took another old photo used your app again the results was very bad. Out of all the photos I tested your app on, I only got one good results. For some reason your app changes the person face. I restore old photos but wanted an app that wouldn’t take me a long time to restore. The old fashion way could take me almost two months. I would love to buy your app, but not like the results I get. Cindy',
