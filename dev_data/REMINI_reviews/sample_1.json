For example the “Pro” Subscription is $5 a week and includes multiple features - but if you’re not careful and subscribe to the “Pro-Lite” model - you’ll only be able to enhance photos (you get none of the other features) but this is also $5 a week! The app itself is nice, they are sneaky with the numerous subscription options and Apple should crack down on this type of dishonesty/ shade offerings.',
