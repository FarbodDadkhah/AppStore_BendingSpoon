And right now when you select your photo you first see a 60 seconds ad, then there is watermark under your photo and the worst is the quality, it makes beards and hair so cartoonish and sharpened it looks so bad and it’s not as smooth and good as it was and when you want save your photo you see another 60 seconds ad.

This is just a strategy or trick for all the new apps. First they make it free with some ads then when they see their app gets famous gets lots of downloads then they add more thing like subscriptions and other stuff.

Still not a bad app.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1470373330&type=Purple%20Software,2023-01-21T12:03:30-07:00,1470373330

I’m still old school, digital photos are great, but still love my 35mm camera. Here’s the problem with your app. I took out some old photos one major photo is of my dad and his best friend. I used your app and Oh My God, I couldn’t believe how your app took a photo that was slightly blurry and needed some tone adjustment and your results was horrible. Your app took my dad’s friend glasses on his face left part of the glasses on his face, the other half was on his lips. Part of his lip was up to his nose, and the results got worse. So I did it again, and it came out the same. I took another old photo used your app again the results was very bad. Out of all the photos I tested your app on, I only got one good results. For some reason your app changes the person face. I restore old photos but wanted an app that wouldn’t take me a long time to restore. The old fashion way could take me almost two months.

1. By default, the app alters the colors unless you manually select the original color after enhancement. This can be quite bothersome. I would appreciate it if the original colors were preserved by default, with the option to change them if desired.
